## Real-World Battery Testing

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **75% brightness, 100% volume, YouTube playback** | 1 hour 17 minutes to 20% battery |
| **Charging while using (5000mAh bank)** | 20% to 88% in 1 hour; 20% to 100% in 1 hour 16 minutes |
| **CPU Temps** | Increase 3-4°C while charging |
| **Battery Temps** | Drop ~1°C when charging begins (bypass charging indicator) |
| **Idle Drain** | Minimal when powered off completely |

## Battery Life by Usage

| Scenario | Battery Life |
|----------|--------------|
| Listening to music (no display) | 6-7+ hours |
| Video streaming (75% brightness) | 1.5-2 hours |
| Remote desktop work | 2-3 hours |
| With 5000mAh bank | 11 hours continuous use |
| With 10,000mAh neck bank | Full day coverage |

## Charging Best Practices

### Do

1. **Overnight Charging**: Power OFF completely (not standby)
2. **Optimal Charging**: Charge when off for fastest speed (32 min, 10%-100%)
3. **While Using**: Budget +1% per minute charge gain with 5000mAh bank

### Don't

1. **Disable Auto-Wake**: Glasses turn on when charging status changes, causing unnecessary drain/heat
2. Leave on standby while plugged in overnight

## Power Bank Recommendations

| Type | Benefit |
|------|---------|
| **5000mAh stick** | +3 hours use, pocket-sized |
| **10,000mAh neck-style** | All-day coverage, hands-free |
| **90° USB-C cables** | 4-6ft length for pocket carry |

See [Accessories](accessories.md) for specific product recommendations.

## Temperature Impact

- Charging while using increases CPU temp by 3-4°C
- Battery temp drops ~1°C when bypass charging activates
- Avoid intensive tasks (Google Lens, AnyDesk, navigation) while charging
- Use Cool or Balanced power mode for extended sessions
