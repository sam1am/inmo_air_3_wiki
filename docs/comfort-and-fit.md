## Nose Pad Considerations

### Stock Pad

- Small, concentrates pressure
- Causes discomfort after 30 minutes
- Leaves marks on nose bridge

### Large Nose Pads (Recommended)

- Available separately (~$6 via Taobao/Superbuy)
- Distribute weight across larger area
- Extend comfortable wear to 2+ hours
- Significant comfort improvement reported

### No Nose Pad

- Reduces weight distribution
- Better screen visibility (no obstruction)
- Causes discomfort after 1+ hour
- May damage frame if used long-term

## IPD Optimization

| IPD Range | Experience |
|-----------|------------|
| **60-65mm** | Optimal range (peak at 62mm) |
| **58mm** | Minor fading at edges |
| **68mm** | Some users achieve 90-95% binocular overlap with adjustment |
| **>68mm or <58mm** | May experience blurry spots or reduced immersion |

### Adjusting for Your IPD

1. Position glasses centered on nose
2. Shift left/right until both displays align
3. Move up/down for vertical alignment
4. Fine-tune until image is clear in both eyes

## Vision Correction

| Condition | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Myopia (nearsightedness)** | Works well with glasses set on nose |
| **Hyperopia/Presbyopia** | Prescription inserts highly recommended |
| **Progressives** | Supported (multi-focal inserts) |
| **AR Coating** | Reduces reflections (optional add-on) |

See [Accessories](accessories.md) for prescription lens details.

## Long-Term Wear Guidelines

| Duration | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| **1 Hour** | Generally comfortable with large pads and adjustment breaks |
| **2+ Hours** | Requires nose pad support and periodic breaks |
| **All-Day** | Not recommended without external battery extension for comfort reasons |
| **Adjustment Period** | Temples loosen slightly over time |

### Tips for Extended Sessions

1. Use large nose pads
2. Take 10-15 minute breaks per hour
3. Adjust position periodically
4. Keep a power bank ready
5. Lower brightness to reduce heat on face

## Positioning Tips

1. **Wear lower on nose** for better comfort
2. **Shift left/right** for optimal binocular alignment
3. **Tilt up/down** to center the display in your vision
4. Screen is positioned in upper FOV, allowing downward vision past it

## Common Comfort Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Nose pain | Get large nose pads |
| Temple pressure | Give temples time to loosen; bend carefully if needed |
| Heat on face | Lower brightness, take breaks |
| Eye strain | Adjust position, take breaks, use dark mode |
