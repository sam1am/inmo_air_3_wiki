## Critical Issues (Require Replacement)

These issues typically require contacting support for replacement. Document with video before contacting support@inmoxr.com.

### Display Failures

- **One display not functioning** - Hardware defect
- **Blue-white wave patterns on left screen** - Hardware defect
- **Double/triple vision with severe focus issues** - Some users report nausea; may be hardware defect vs. normal waveguide artifacts

**First steps**: Force restart (hold power 10+ seconds), full charge, factory reset. If persists, request replacement.

### Hardware Failures

- **Non-functional camera** - Detected but no preview/image
- **Won't power on** - Despite confirmed charging
- **Boot loop** - Logo appears then freezes during startup

**Action**: Contact support@inmoxr.com with video documentation, backer/order number, and purchase date.

## Screen Burn-In

**Problem**: Temporary or permanent image retention on OLED display

### Prevention

- Power OFF (not standby) when charging overnight
- Use dark mode or third-party launchers
- Lower brightness below 50% for idle periods
- Minimize static UI elements

### Recovery

- Temporary burn-in usually resolves in 24 hours
- Play full-screen video to "exercise" pixels
- Lower brightness further if persists

## Brightness Auto-Reset

**Problem**: Brightness resets to default when display wakes

### Workaround

- Check "Display Settings" for auto-brightness toggle
- May require manual adjustment on wake
- No permanent fix yet; INMO investigating

## Display Issues

### Ghosting/Double Vision

- **Cause**: Waveguide reflection with high-contrast content
- **Nature**: Inherent to 1D waveguide design
- **Workaround**: View external screens at angle or use one eye

### Rainbow/Shimmer Effect

- **Cause**: Vertical waveguide lines visible when viewing screens/bright objects
- **Mitigation**: Reduced with dark mode and proper screen positioning
- **Note**: Not removable, but acceptable to most users

### Home Bar Ghost Image

- **Cause**: Faint taskbar visible in corner due to reflection
- **Solution**: Use third-party launcher to hide stock bar

---

## Camera Issues

### Plug Removal

- Camera cover extremely recessed
- **Tools needed**: Toothpick, needle, or scotch tape
- Don't force; use small tool with care

### Shutter Sound

- Cannot disable in stock app
- Third-party camera apps may allow disabling

---

## Bluetooth Connectivity

### Issues

- Connection drops with multiple apps open
- Touchpad firmware updates improve reliability
- **International version**: Must manually re-pair Bluetooth devices each time (Chinese version maintains pairing)

### Solutions

- Close unused background apps
- Update touchpad firmware to v1.1.1
- Re-pair if persistent issues
- For international version users: Keep devices in pairing mode for quicker reconnection

## Touchpad & Input Issues

**Issue**: Touchpad gestures incompatible with many third-party apps

- Connect a Bluetooth keyboard for text input
- Use [Mudra Link wristband](https://www.mudra.link/) for gesture control
- Stick to apps designed for touchpad navigation

---

## Device Freeze/Unresponsive

**Issue**: Glasses freeze during use (often while streaming video) and won't turn back on

### Symptoms

- Display freezes completely
- Device shuts off and won't power on
- No charging indicator light when plugged in
- Device may feel slightly warm

### Solution

1. Plug in the charging cable
2. Leave charging for about 10 minutes
3. With the power cord still plugged in, press and hold the power button for 25 seconds
4. Device should restart and function normally

**Note**: This has been reported to occur during Netflix streaming. The extended button press while charging appears to force a hard reset.

---

## Battery Instability

**Issue**: Sudden shutdowns at 18% or other unexpected battery levels

- **Cause**: Battery calibration issues or unstable discharge
- **Reality check**: Rated 7 hours vs. actual ~2 hours video playback at 75% brightness

### Solutions

- Perform full discharge/charge cycles occasionally to recalibrate
- Don't rely on low battery percentages; charge earlier
- Consider external power bank for extended use

---

## Minor Hardware Issues

### Shade Hinge Creaking

- Some units have creaky hinges on the shade attachment
- Cosmetic/minor annoyance; does not affect function

### Model Sticker Peeling

- Sticker on temples may peel over time
- Cosmetic only; no functional impact

---

## Overheating (Chinese Version)

**Issue**: Extreme heat during video calls, navigation, remote desktop

**Cause**: Continuous background apps and less efficient cooling

### Solutions

1. Upgrade to international version if possible
2. Disable background apps
3. Add foam heat shields
4. Avoid charging while using intensive apps
